\cvproject{\href{https://github.com/asurprenant15/MLProj/blob/master/ECON\%20706-420\%20Final\%20Project.pdf}{Time Series Forecasting with CNN}}
\begin{itemize}
\item The goal of this project was to \\ determine the viability of\\ Convulutional Neural Networks for Multivariate time series forecasting. 
\item We compared the predictions of our model against a simple Feedforward Neural Network to see if there was any benefit to using CNN as \\theorized. 
\item Supervised learning on both\\ simulated and real world data.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Predicting Churn from telecom data with 80\% accuracy.
\item The Project analyzes the data set to determine the most important \\ features and compares the \\ predictions of a Logistic Regression against a Support Vector Machine.
